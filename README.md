Thaumic Utilities

This is a derivative fork of [this project](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/thaumic-utilities) that I felt needed a couple more tweaks.

Notable changes:
- Fixed vis amulet HUD alignment
- Added compat for Forbidden Magic
- Improved vis amulet tooltip tweak
- Numeric runic shielding display
- Numeric warp display tooltip on Sanity Meter
- Eldritch Guardian attack/ignore threshold
